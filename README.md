## About

Vino VR was created on the idea of a full sensorial wine experience. A 1999 study found the that right tune paired with your favorite wine could improve the wine taste by 15%. . For centuries we dedicated all our efforts in pairing the best meals with the perfect wine. But, how about we pick our wine base on our mood or in the most difficult of days we induce that mood?
In a time of full customizable everything, shouldn't wine be customized to your needs? Great news, Michigan State university researchers are already testing “an assessment pairing wine to characteristics of the drinker instead of the bottle”.

Stress and anxiety heighten your perception of bitterness and astringency, opening a highly tannic red wine when you are angry and frustrated will cause the wine to appear excessively aggressive and hard edge. The same bottle on a lazy Sunday surrounded by loved ones will appear elegant and nuanced in comparison.

We cut the guess work with tannins and acidity out of the way. Pick your mood we pick the wine then send you somewhere to unwind, or relax, celebrate perhaps. It’s going to be a blast, Saluti!

## Usage

## Roadmap

In the future we would like to add the ability to access your account made on our portal site and see your saved wines, or get new suggestions, make more user friendly playlist functionality, and increase the quiality of the surrounding environment.
